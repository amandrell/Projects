Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the project 2 side?

A: The hexagon is a combination of size, row size and offset. Create one hexagon and then tesselate other hexagon around one another
based on position.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: I would figure out how to create one room and generate a bunch of rooms that do not overlap. Maybe create and subdivide
leaves.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A hallway is a path between rooms. A room is randomly spaced in a leaf.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A:

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: I think I will be using the Binary space partitioning algorithim. It seems simple, clear, and efficient.
